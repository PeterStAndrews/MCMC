# MCMC

## Overview

`MCMC` is an educational library that contains several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and optimisation algorithms. Distribution sampling is
ubiquitous throughout data science. In its simplest form, sampling a distribution builds a picture of the concentration of measure  over the 
parameter space. MCMC techniques include a wide variety of methods; each however, will contain memoryless 
updates and the use of random numbers to decide which region of a distribution to explore next.
